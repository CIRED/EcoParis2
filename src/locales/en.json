        "about": "EcoParis is an interactive visualization of map data of ecosystem services in urban and peri-urban areas in the Ile-de-France region from the <a href=\"https://idefese.wordpress.com/\">IDEFESE</a>project.",
        "start": "For starters, you can select a layer to display among nutrient retention, temperature reduction, pollination or groundwater recharge measurements.",
        "future": "You can also choose to display the estimated evolution of these measures by 2030 in a climate change scenario.",
        "credits": "EcoParis has been designed by students of the <a href=\"https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/data-visualization-COM-480\">Data Visualization</a> course at EPFL, with the help of Perrine Hamel of the Stanford <a href=\"https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/\">Natural Capital Project</a>."
